  <article class="mt-6 space-y-8 text-justify">

    <p>The forest is a quiet cathedral built by wind. Trees stand like tall, patient saints, sunlight filtering through their leaves like stained glass. The ground is soft, the air is green, and every sound feels like it arrived from a great distance.</p>

    <p>There is a kind of peace here that cities don't know. A stillness so complete it feels alive. You hear birds like scattered bells. You hear your own heartbeat. You hear silence—full, not empty.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">The Language of Leaves</h2>
    <p>Leaves do not speak, yet they communicate. When wind rushes through them, they whisper in fluent movement. Their shadows shift like ripples across bark. Every rustle is a scripture of seasons.</p>

    <p>Some trees have seen centuries. Empires rose and fell, and they stood. They remember storms. They remember rain that came like prayer. They remember wind strong enough to bend them but not break them.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Why We Return to Nature</h2>
    <p>Humans were not designed for neon lights and concrete. We came from earth, from soil, from places where water curve and branches weave. That is why forests feel like something inside us is returning home.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-4 border-yellow-600 italic">
      Nature does not hurry, yet everything is completed.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Maybe we need the forest not to escape life, but to remember how to live it. Slowly, gently, like branches growing toward light without apology.</p>
