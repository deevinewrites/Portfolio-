<article class="mt-6 prose text-justify">
<p>Rain began like a fine thread — patient and polite — and by the time Mara reached Riverlane it had become a steady wash, as if the town were rinsing itself for something it could not yet name. The streetlights hummed in the grey, and the houses outlined themselves in wet paper. Riverlane had always worn its past like a second skin: slow, stitched, and oddly comfortable. Even in the rain it kept its distance from the busy city, preferring small transactions of silence and memory.</p>
<p>She should have stayed on the bus. She could have gone home to the flat where her phone charged by the bed and the kettle knew the shape of her impatience. But the corner where the old blue house sat had a gravity that felt personal. For years it had been a rumor — a boarded-up sentence; no one went there unless they had to. Tonight the door was open.</p>
<p>That single small detail changed everything. A door that opens in Riverlane behaves like a punctuation mark: it demands to be read. Mara stepped onto the porch because she had learned to answer punctuation with action. Inside, the entry smelled of lemon oil and dust, a domestic perfume that surprised her with the intimacy of the scent. Light trembled from a candle on the dining table, its flame steady in the draft as if someone had tamed the air.</p>
<p>On the table, folded like an offering, lay a note. Her name — MARA — was written in a hand that had once folded itself into other peoples’ lives so carefully they mistook it for ordinary. The letters were slightly slanted, each stroke a small, familiar ache.</p>
<p><em>MARA — YOU'RE LATE.</em></p>
<p>The message was both accusation and welcome. Her first impulse was practical: someone playing a trick, a neighbor with a cruel sense of humour. Her second impulse was memory: the butcher who once wrapped cash in yesterday’s newspaper; the grocer who tied your change into a small neat thing. Her third impulse — the one that finally anchored her feet — was recognition. The curl on the R. She had seen it in envelopes bound in twine, in the margins of lists of chores. Her hands went cold not from the air but from the idea that handwriting could be an inheritance.</p>
