  <article class="mt-6 space-y-8 text-justify">

    <p>Zanzibar does not welcome you quietly — it embraces you like warm water against bare skin. The air smells of sea salt and cloves, and for a moment, nothing else exists except wind, waves, and the soft feeling of arrival.</p>

    <p>Every island has a soul, and Zanzibar’s is slow. Not lazy — gentle. Like the ocean has seen centuries come and go and decided that nothing needs to be rushed. The waves move like they are keeping a sacred rhythm only the island understands.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">The Sound of Blue</h2>
    <p>The ocean here isn’t just water. It is blue in layers — sapphire, turquoise, teal — colours you think only exist in edited pictures until you are standing knee-deep in them. Boats sway like they are breathing with the tide.</p>

    <p>Fishermen speak to the sea like an old friend. Children run barefoot with clothes still dripping from saltwater. Tourists watch sunsets that look painted by hand. Life here is a language without words.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Stone Town — A City Built from Memory</h2>
    <p>Stone Town is a maze of narrow alleys, wooden doors carved with Arabic poetry, and marketplaces where the scent of cardamom and grilled fish clings to your clothes. Every corner feels like history still whispering.</p>

    <p>You buy mangos you did not plan for. You meet a woman selling fabrics so bright they look like sunlight woven into cotton. You realise some experiences cannot be photographed — they must be lived.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-4 border-yellow-600 italic">
      Some cities you explore. Zanzibar is one you feel.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">The Art of Doing Nothing</h2>
    <p>One afternoon you sit on the beach with bare feet buried in warm sand. You watch dhows drifting across the horizon. The world feels slow, almost holy. For the first time in a long time, your mind is not running — it is floating.</p>

    <p>Not every journey is about distance. Some are about slowing the storm inside yourself.</p>
